# 90daysOfHtmlAndCss
## Welcome in my project 90daysOfHtmlAndCss
Basically, this project will be develope by 90 days. Every day I will try to use my current knowledge of HTML and CSS to build something useful, interesting, simple, and good looking. So, I am happy I am here because I'm going to get a lot of knowledge about HTML and CSS. The most important thing is purely using HTML and CSS only. No JavaScript, Webpack, npm, Node.js, SASS, CSS frameworks, and other similar stuff. So if you will see animations, interactions, and stand-out projects I guarantee it will be only HTML and CSS.v
